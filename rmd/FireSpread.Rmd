Introduction

:   **In this project, we explored the relationship between temperature and fire spread rate in Canada. We visualized the distribution of fire spread rate and temperature, calculated the correlation coefficient, performed a linear regression analysis, and conducted a hypothesis test to determine whether the observed relationship is statistically significant. Additionally, we created a geospatial representation of fire spread rate along with temperature to better understand the spatial patterns and relationships between these variables.**

:   **The results of the hypothesis test indicate whether there is a statistically significant relationship between temperature and fire spread rate.**
