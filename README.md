**Analyzing the impact of temperature and wind speed on wildfire spread using predictive modeling.**

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding the key factors that influence the spread of wildfires, specifically temperature and wind speed. By using predictive modeling techniques, aim to provide insights into how these factors contribute to the behavior of wildfires over time.

## Features
- Predictive models analyzing the correlation between temperature, wind speed, and fire spread.
- Visualization of fire spread patterns under varying environmental conditions.
- Insights into the critical thresholds of temperature and wind speed that significantly impact fire behavior.
